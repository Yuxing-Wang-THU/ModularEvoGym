# ModularEvoGym
This is a modified benchmark which provides a modular soft robot design space and a modular state-action space for designing and controlling 2D Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs). ModularEvoGym is based on [EvolutionGym](https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym)

**New features**:
Design (optional)
1. A modular design space for VSRs.
2. A designer (design policy network) based on Neural Cellular Automata.

Control
1. A modular state-action space for VSRs.
2. A universal Transformer-based controller (control policy network) which can be trained by PPOï¼ˆProximal Policy Optimization).
