# ModularEvoGym
This is a modified benchmark which provides a modular soft robot design space and a modular state-action space for designing and controlling 2D Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs). ModularEvoGym is based on [EvolutionGym](https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym)

## New features

<font color=Blue>Design (optional):</font>

1. A modular design space for VSRs which can be incorporated into the Reinforcement Learning process.

2. A universal **Designer** (design policy network) based on Neural Cellular Automata (NCA).

<font color=Blue>Control:</font>

1. A modular state-action space for VSRs.

2. A universal Transformer-based **Controller** (control policy network) which can be trained by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
